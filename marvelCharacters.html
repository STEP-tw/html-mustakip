              "Tony" Stark is a character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the
              Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the
              Marvel Comics character of the same name and known commonly by his
              alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, Tony Stark is an industrialist,
              genius inventor, and consummate playboy who is CEO of Stark
              Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons
              manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart
              and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of powered
              exoskeleton suits of armor which he uses to defend against those
              that would threaten peace around the world.

              Thor Odinson is a character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the
              Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the
              Marvel Comics character of the same name. In the films, Thor is
              one of the most powerful of the Asgardians, an alien civilization
              with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on
              Earth (and by themselves) to be gods. Thor himself is titled the
              "God of Thunder". The Asgardians have advanced science that seems
              like magic to people of Earth, typified in Thor's case by his
              hammer, Mjolnir, with which he can summon lightning through most
              of the films. Thor in the MCU has borrowed a number of
              characteristics and story lines from across the fifty-plus year
              history of the character in Marvel Comics. However, unlike most
              other characters in the franchise, Thor has no superhero "alter
              ego", a characteristic that also differs from the original comic
              book version of Thor.

              Stephen Vincent Strange M.D., Ph.D was a powerful sorcerer and a
              leading member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. Originally a
              brilliant yet arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange had suffered a car
              accident, resulting in his hands becoming crippled. When Western
              medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey that led him to
              Kamar-Taj where Strange had made the discovery of magic and
              alternate dimensions, being trained by the Ancient One. Though
              focused on healing his hands, Strange learned more of the mystic
              arts and helped the Masters prevent Kaecilius from merging Earth
              with their Dark Dimension, but not before witnessing the Ancient
              One's death. With the demise of his mentor, Strange became the
              protector of the New York Sanctum within New York City as well as
              Earth's protector from any inter-dimensional threats.
