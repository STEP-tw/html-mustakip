        into the creation of powered exoskeleton suits of armor which he uses to
        defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.

        Thor Odinson is a character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics
        character of the same name. In the films, Thor is one of the most
        powerful of the Asgardians, an alien civilization with long ties to
        Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth (and by themselves)
        to be gods. Thor himself is titled the "God of Thunder". The Asgardians
        have advanced science that seems like magic to people of Earth, typified
        in Thor's case by his hammer, Mjolnir, with which he can summon
        lightning through most of the films. Thor in the MCU has borrowed a
        number of characteristics and story lines from across the fifty-plus
        year history of the character in Marvel Comics. However, unlike most
        other characters in the franchise, Thor has no superhero "alter ego", a
        characteristic that also differs from the original comic book version of
        Thor.

        American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist Steve
        Ditko and writer Stan Lee,[1] the character first appeared in Strange
        Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963). Doctor Strange serves as the

        Dr. Bruce Banner is a character portrayed first by Edward Norton and
        currently by Mark Ruffalo in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film
        franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and
        known commonly by his alter ego, Hulk. In the films, Dr. Banner, is a
        renowned physicist who subjected himself to a gamma radiation experiment
        designed to replicate a World War II-era "super soldier" program. The
        experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green,
        hulking beast whenever his heart rate goes above 200 bpm or if he is
        placed in mortal danger. The Hulk is incredibly strong and acts largely
        on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that is
        perceives as a threat. Banner has demonstrated an increasing ability to
        control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but is generally
        not able to recall events during the time he is in that form. The Hulk,
        conversely, has become increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall
        the transformation back - one time staying in Hulk form for two years,
        becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. As
        of 2018, the character is one of the central figures of the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe, having appeared in five films of the series, one
        uncredited cameo in Iron Man 3, and will appear in the upcoming film
        Avengers: Endgame.
